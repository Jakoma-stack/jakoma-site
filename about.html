    <h1>About Jakoma</h1>
    <p><strong>Jakoma is a digital and data powerhouse — engineered for privacy, autonomy, and growth.</strong></p>
    <p>Founded by a former public sector informatics leader with a deep technical background and a mission for equity and autonomy, Jakoma was built to solve real-world problems with elegance and scale.</p>
    <p>We believe in privacy-preserving tech, actionable strategy, and performance-driven products that allow founders, funders, and public sector leaders to lead with integrity — and without compromise.</p>

    <h2>About the Name</h2>
    <p>Jakoma is more than a brand. It's a quiet legacy — formed from the personal roots of its founder, and carrying the vision of ethical, anonymous, and life-changing digital systems that serve people, not platforms.</p>
