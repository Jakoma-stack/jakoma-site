      <h1>About Jakoma</h1>
      <p><strong>Jakoma exists to make smart, ethical digital tools accessible — and effective — for the people building real things.</strong></p>

      <p>We're not a VC-backed startup or faceless tech firm. We're a solo-built, purpose-led brand shaped by 22 years in public service, data leadership, and digital transformation. From frontline social care to AI strategy in healthcare, we've lived what most just write about.</p>

      <p>Jakoma is the umbrella brand for a growing portfolio of products and services — including <a href="https://applysmart.co.uk" target="_blank">ApplySmart</a> and the <a href="https://100to10k.com" target="_blank">100to10k Challenge</a>. Every project is rooted in our belief that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>🚀 Smart tools should reduce stress, not create more.</li>
        <li>🔐 Privacy and data ethics are non-negotiable.</li>
        <li>💡 The best solutions are simple, repeatable, and human-led.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Jakoma was founded by a digital leader with an MSc in Data Science, a Masters in Public Administration, and a postgrad in Leadership — but more importantly, someone who’s helped thousands navigate complex systems and build practical outcomes, not just plans.</p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>We help solopreneurs, founders, and small teams:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚙️ Launch or grow with smart, pre-built tools and digital assets</li>
        <li>📊 Use data for better decisions, not just dashboards</li>
        <li>🔍 Navigate IG, GDPR, and digital compliance with clarity</li>
        <li>🧠 Build AI readiness, without the hype</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Everything we offer is shaped to support autonomy, privacy, and progress — no fluff, no funnel-hacking, just smart support for serious people.</p>

      <p>We’re just getting started — and if you value clarity, action, and results, you’re in the right place.</p>
